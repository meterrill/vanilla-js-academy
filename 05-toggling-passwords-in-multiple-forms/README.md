# Toggling passwords in multiple forms

We have two separate forms that show up on the same pageâ€”one to change your username and another to change your password.

Both have password fields in them, and for each form we want to include a checkbox that lets the user toggle password visibility on or off. But, each checkbox should only toggle the fields in its own form.
