# Weather App - Plug-in

Modify our *weather app* script to convert it into a plugin.

Developers should be able to:
- Provide a required API key.
- Pick the selector to render the weather into.
- Show temperatures in Fahrenheit or Celsius.
- Change the rendered message (i.e., `It's currently {temperature} and {conditions} in {location}`).
- Change the rendered message if no weather data is available.
- Show or hide the icon for weather conditions.
