# Countdown Timer

Format the time in our *Countdown Timer* before rendering it into the UI. Instead of `60` seconds as our duration, letâ€™s use `120`. Before rendering the time into the UI, convert it into `M:SS` format. (i.e., the starting time should be displayed at `2:00`. When the remaining time is `5` seconds, it should be displayed as `0:05`.)
