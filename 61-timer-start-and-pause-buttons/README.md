# Timer - Start, Pause, and Restart Buttons

Add two always-present buttons below the countdown in our *Countdown Timer*.

One button will say *Start* when the timer is stopped, and *Pause* when itâ€™s running. Clicking it starts or stops the timer without resetting the time.

The second, *Restart*, will reset the time to its original value and start the timer over again.
