# Filter Places

Modify our *Places* app to let users mark locations they’ve already visited, and filter places by ones they’ve favorited, visited, or haven’t visited.

There are two things you need to do for this project:

1. Add a “Visited” button for users to mark off locations they’ve already been to. Like the “Favorites” button, visited locations should be saved between visits.
2. When the user selects one of the filters, change the UI to only show locations that match the filter criteria.
